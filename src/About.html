                <h1>Hey, It's Sinsine here</h1>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Yirgalem, small town of Sidama, surrounded by beautiful hills and a close-knit community.
                    Life there was simple. I grew up with 3 older brothers. They taught me the importance of connection, resilience, and appreciating the little 
                    things in life and of cource treated me like a princess. My family has a big impact on who I am today and I'm grateful for them. From a 
                    young age, I was fascinated by how things worked. This curiosity sparked dreams of exploring beyond my small town and creating 
                     something meaningful
                     </p>
                <p>
                    During my school years at Tsinat High School, I worked hard and achieved academic excellence, which gave me the foundation and 
                    confidence to pursue my dreams. Now, as a third-year software engineering student, I’m turning those dreams into reality. My journey isn’t 
                    just about learning to code or building systems; it’s about using technology to solve real-world problems. I’m particularly passionate about 
                    raising awareness around mental health because I believe technology can help connect people, share knowledge, and support those who 
                    need it most

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>My hobbies are a big part of who I am and how I spend my time. I enjoy playing video games, as they not only provide a fun escape but 
                    also challenge me to think critically and solve problems in creative ways</p>
                    <p>I’m also a huge football fan (Liverpool fan). Watching matches, analyzing plays, and following my favorite teams bring me so much 
                        excitement. Football is more than just a sport to me ,it’s a source of inspiration and a way to connect with others who share the same 
                        passion.</p>
                        <p>Reading books is another hobby I cherish and I love painting. It has a way of lifting my spirits and giving me a deeper appreciation for 
                            emotions and creativity.
                            </p>
