      <h1>Hey, It's Sinsine here</h1>
           <p>
            I grew up in Yirgalem, small town of Sidama, surrounded by beautiful hills and a close-knit community. 
            Life there was simple. I grew up with 3 older brothers.They taught me the importance of 
            connection, resilience, and appreciating the little things in life and of cource treated me like a princess.My family has a big impact on who I am today and I'm grateful for them.
           From a young age, I was fascinated by how things worked. This curiosity sparked dreams of exploring beyond my small town and 
           creating something meaningful.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my school years at Tsinat High School, I worked hard and achieved academic excellence, 
                which gave me the foundation and confidence to pursue my dreams.
                Now, as a third-year software engineering student, I’m turning those dreams into reality. 
                My journey isn’t just about learning to code or building systems; it’s about using technology to solve real-world problems. 
                I’m particularly passionate about raising awareness around mental health because I believe technology can help connect people, 
                share knowledge, and support those who need it most.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                 <p>
                    My hobbies are a big part of who I am and how I spend my time. I enjoy playing video games, 
                    as they not only provide a fun escape but also challenge me to think critically and solve problems in creative ways.
                 </p>
                 <p>I’m also a huge football fan (Liverpool fan). Watching matches, analyzing plays, and following my favorite teams bring me so much excitement. 
                    Football is more than just a sport to me—it’s a source of inspiration and a way to connect with others who share the same passion.</p>
                    <p>Reading books is another hobby I cherish and  I love painting. It has a way of lifting my spirits and giving me a deeper appreciation 
                        for emotions and creativity.
                   </p>
